#Employee App Sample Application
This application is a simple Java web application of employees that implements the CRUD operations using Bootstrap to add UI styles, Tomcat as the embedded server, and Maven to compile and package the dependencies needed to run the web application standalone.

Application files:
* `src` directory: contains source files
* pom.xml: defines dependencies required to run Tomcat in the embedded mode, and the plugins to compile and package the application in a single uber JAR
* manifest.json: provides metadata of the Java application, including the Java version and the command to run the application
